*** THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS WITH GCC/G++ ***
*** CLANG WILL NOT WORK ***

When this project was made, the original source code written in C++ was lost. It is quite
simple so I shall retype it soon. In the mean time, enjoy a quick way to convert all your
C++ files into .o and .so files provided you are using GCC/G++ :)
